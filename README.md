# Create Todo List React App easily with Material UI

To begin:
Clone the repo and do npm install
<br />
`npm start`

In my project you can see: Form.jsx, FormInput.jsx, List.jsx.
You can create as many components as you want and name it how you like.

In this project Material-UI is used.

Material-UI was developed based on the Roboto font.
The Roboto font will not be automatically loaded into Material-UI.
*So be sure to install it.*

It is a basic todo list app to add new task and to edit and delete existing tasks.
